ai prompts:

I want to use jsPsych animation plugin to make an experiment online that shows the participant a series of faces and has them code whether that person seems trustworthy or not (or maybe happy vs. sad, etc). Is there an experimental article somewhere that has a similar method that I could replicate? 

how do I make images show up in my experiment in javascript? I have a folder called 'images' but it isn't working. Do I have to have something in my html?
